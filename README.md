# Retail Sales and Payment Analysis

- Python (Pandas, Regex)
- PostgreSQL (data preparation)
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- Github (version control)

## 🧰 Project Steps
1. Cleaned and transformed Excel data using Python.
2. Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
3. Used SQL to join and aggregate data across orders, products, customers, payments, and credit cards.
4. Visualized insights such as total revenue, products performance, customer analysis, and payment insights using Power BI dashboards.
